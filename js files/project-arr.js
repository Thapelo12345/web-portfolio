        description: "In this project, I initially used free APIs available to me. However, since I am learning to write code, I thought it would be a great idea to build my own API. So, I did, and I have it hosted on Render. I built both the API and the web page you see here. For the app, I used React, React Router, and an external API to fetch movie data. The purpose of this app is to fetch movies and display information such as the movie's length, genres, and a brief description of what the movie is about."
