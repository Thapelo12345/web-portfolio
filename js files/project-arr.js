        description: "I built a dessert app based on a Figma design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a pixel-perfect and fully responsive experience. First, I translated the Figma layout into semantic HTML, structuring the app with sections for featured desserts, categories, and user interactions. Using CSS Flexbox and Grid, I made the layout adaptive across various screen sizes, implementing media queries for smooth responsiveness. JavaScript added interactivity, such as a dynamic menu, filtering options, and animations. I optimized images and used lazy loading for better performance. Finally, I tested across devices to refine usability, ensuring a seamless user experience."

        description: "In this project, I initially used free APIs available to me. However, since I am learning to write code, I thought it would be a great idea to build my own API. So, I did, and I have it hosted on Render. I built both the API and the web page you see here. For the app, I used React, React Router, and an external API to fetch movie data. The purpose of this app is to fetch movies and display information such as the movie's length, genres, and a brief description of what the movie is about."

        description: "I was coding a Figma-designed application form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The design had a sleek layout with dynamic input validation. However, I faced a challenge with aligning form elements perfectly while keeping the responsiveness intact. The problem was that the input fields and labels would shift on smaller screens, breaking the design. To solve this, I used CSS Flexbox and media queries to ensure proper alignment across all devices. I also added JavaScript validation to enhance user experience."

I created a React project and structured components for form fields, buttons, and validation messages. Using HTML and CSS, I ensured the layout matched the design, applying Flexbox and Grid for responsiveness. I used jQuery for additional UI enhancements, such as dynamic field validation and animations. Form data was managed using React state, and validation was handled using both jQuery and Reactâ€™s built-in validation techniques. Finally, I tested for responsiveness and user experience."
